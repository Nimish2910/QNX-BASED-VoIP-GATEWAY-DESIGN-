# Project : QNX based VoIP Gateway Design Evaluation

## Executive Summary
The project undertook the development and assessment of a VoIP Gateway on the Broadcom BCM2711 processor. From establishing a QNX build environment to booting QNX and scripting with Linux, each phase was meticulously executed. The successful implementation of a PBX system using Asterisk highlighted the processor's capability in telecom scenarios. Additionally, a Morse Code decoder and encoder application was developed, demonstrating the processor's robust performance in complex telecom tasks.

## Problem Statement and Objectives
The project's aim was to assess the suitability of the Broadcom BCM2837 processor for VoIP applications by evaluating its hardware capabilities, software performance, and overall efficiency in real-time telecom tasks.

## Approach and Methodology for Evaluation
The methodology involved setting up various operating environments, creating a PBX system, developing telecom applications, and conducting extensive scripting to evaluate the processor's performance.

### Key Phases:
- **Module 1:** Set up QNX SDP and momentics
- **Module 2:** Boot QNX on Raspberry Pi 4 B.
- **Module 3:** Script execution at startup in Linux for system monitoring.
- **Module 4:** PBX system construction with Asterisk.
- **Module 5:** Development of Iot application on QNX.
- **Module 6:** Scripting on QNX
