# Project 1: Vortex Flow Meter

## Executive Summary
This project centers around the evaluation of the ARM Cortex M4's capabilities in creating a Vortex Flow Meter. Over six phases, we explored various aspects of embedded system architecture, including software development in C, hardware functionalities such as GPIO, ADC, and UART, RTOS thread management, auto configuration with STM Cube MX, and bare-metal flow meter simulation using MATLAB's Simulink.

## Objectives
The aim was to thoroughly test the ARM Cortex M4 in various scenarios to assess its suitability for Vortex Flow Meter applications, focusing on hardware-software integration and performance across multiple programming environments.

## Evaluation and Methodology
The evaluation process included:
- Module 1: Comparison between assembly and C implementations.
- Module 2: Hardware interfacing and functionality tests.
- Module 3: Real-time operation with RTOS threads.
- Module 4: Start-up code generation and comparison with STM Cube MX.
- Module 5: Debug monitor implementation and system benchmarking.
- Module 6: Simulation of a flow meter using frequency detection algorithms in Simulink and implementation on the MCU.

## Test Results
Each module underwent rigorous testing, providing insights into the system's robustness, adaptability, and efficiency in tasks ranging from simple GPIO manipulations to complex simulations involving real-time data processing.

## List of Deliverables
